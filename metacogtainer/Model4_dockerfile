# This file was copied in the third COPY statement that collects the whole Model4 folder.
# This reads in the max_disc_list.csv generated by the evaluator, the most likely distribution
#       type for each data point.
# Each datapoint is checked to see if the model number is equal to the most likely distribution 
#       type (specified by an index number), if so the model is also called to calculate FA_CD.
# The FA_CD calculation for each model is saved to fa_cd_model_n.csv
# Each value is reset to zero at model start so that if files already exist the value is overwritten,
#       this ensures that values are not residual across multiple runtimes.
