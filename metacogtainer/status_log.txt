Changed the setup script to be done through Docker Compose instead of the Python SDK.
The models now also run in parallel, this is set up in the docker compose .yml file (Lesya's idea)
The ./Models folder has been merged with the ./Containers folder for clarity. The dockerfiles for the model containers have been updated to reflect this
The terminal output now generates a lot of error / warning messages for the TensorFlow version
docker compose up -> starts the system // docker compose down -> stops the system
docker compose up -d -> detaches the system (does not produce output directly), but runs slightly faster (about 90 seconds)

Containers are not built and left in memory now, Docker Compose reuses the same containers and deletes them when closed
Files' values are reset on Model-0 container, so that results do not persist after system finishes
Results Container only prints the FA Ideal if run_ideal=True in the Args Class Module
Results Container now saves to metacog_results.csv in the format : (fa_cd, fa_glrt, fa_ideal)
Added page to wiki on Notion (Modular Metacog - Setup / Running)
Added txt version of wiki to folder : system_description.txt
