Changed the setup script to be done through Docker Compose instead of the Python SDK.
The models now also run in parallel, this is set up in the docker compose .yml file (Lesya's idea)
The ./Models folder has been merged with the ./Containers folder for clarity. The dockerfiles for the model containers have been updated to reflect this
The terminal output now generates a lot of error / warning messages for the TensorFlow version
docker compose up -> starts the system // docker compose down -> stops the system
docker compose up -d -> detaches the system (does not produce output directly), but runs slightly faster (about 90 seconds)

Containers are not built and left in memory now, Docker Compose reuses the same containers and deletes them when closed
Files' values are reset on Model-0 container, so that results do not persist after system finishes
Results Container only prints the FA Ideal if run_ideal=True in the Args Class Module
Results Container now saves to metacog_results.csv in the format : (fa_cd, fa_glrt, fa_ideal)
Added page to wiki on Notion (Modular Metacog - Setup / Running)
Added txt version of wiki to folder : system_description.txt

Working on converting Docker Compose to run in Kubernetes.
Learning how to use Argo Workflows to implement a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) within Kubernetes
Running into issues on pulling images locally.
Looking into local kubernetes docker registry and authentication.
Going back to try and run a single pod (metacog-discriminator) in base kubernetes

7/12/2023 Ryan F -
Created a local docker registry and pushed the images to a folder - Not a good solution
Learning how to make a Directed Acyclic Graph, for running containers in a specified order using Dependencies - Did not work as of today
Implemented Local Docker Image access in Kubernetes
	Activate Kubernetes in Docker Desktop
	Change kubectl context to Docker Desktop to : kubectl config use-context docker-desktop
Went through basic Kubernetes tutorials to learn how the application works

Created documentation on the Kubernetes Metacog Job
Added comments to the YAML file
Looking into ways to improve the system, maybe creating a simple website hosting locally that displays the results of the metacog system?
Downloaded D70 Powerpoint Template, have not started yet though
Implemented parallel process in Kubernetes metacog job -> runtime went from about four minutes to two and a half
    ^ metacog-results will cause error, as it will not find file, but will restart until model-0 through model-6 finish and then execute correctly
