### label: metacog-discriminator

##  The second Dockerfile

# Inherits from the metacog-base Docker Image.
#   (Takes everything what metacog-base, 'Dockerfile_base', did and use it)
FROM metacog-base

# Copies 'Discriminator' (the container folder) from your computer (.\GitHub\Dynamic-CFAR\metacogtainer/Containers/Discriminator) to the Docker Container's main folder.
COPY ./Containers/Discriminator /

# Copies 'Datasets' from your computer to the Datasets folder in the Docker Container.
COPY ./Datasets /Datasets

# Copies 'Args_Class_Module.py' from your computer (.\GitHub\Dynamic-CFAR\metacogtainer/) to the main directory in the Docker Container.
COPY ./Args_Class_Module.py /Args_Class_Module.py

# Runs the specific Discriminator code segment from the Dynamic-CFAR algorithm
#      specified in the corresponding Python Script.
# This file was copied in the first COPY statement that collects the whole Discriminator folder.
# This reads in the Data file specified by the Args Class and outputs distribution_tensors.csv,
#       which is the probability list for each data point corresponding to the likelihood
#       of each radar distribution.
# There can only be one CMD instruction in a Dockerfile. If you list more than one CMD then only the last CMD will take effect.
# Do not confuse RUN with CMD. RUN actually runs a command and commits the result; CMD does not execute anything at build time, but specifies the intended # # # command for the image.
